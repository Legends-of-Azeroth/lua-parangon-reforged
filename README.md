# (Lua) Parangon Reforged

Lua Parangon Reforged is a massive update to the existing Paragon level system.
This new version allows you to create your own list of statistics and also allows you to customize a number of options inherent in the script.

The script is adaptable, that is to say that you have 5 or 25 statistics the script will adapt to your needs.
It is also possible to call methods outside the script, you can for example use methods such as : 

```
player:SetParangonXP(amount)
player:SetParangonLevel(amount)
player:SetParangonStat(stat_id, stat_val)
```
